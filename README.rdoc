= HelpersAnywhere

HelpersAnywhere is a Rails plugin that will let you access helpers 
anywhere, hence the name. One use case would be to let you use the
URL helpers in your rake tasks and mailers.

Caveat emptor: If you feel the need for this, you're quite possibly 
doing it wrong.

== Installation

 script/plugin install git://github.com/elektronaut/helpers_anywhere.git

Then add the following line to your initializers:

 HelpersAnywhere.default_domain = "mydomain.com"

== Usage

Examples:

 include HelpersAnywhere

 with_helper do
   textilize "Hello world"
   time_ago_in_words(2.days.ago)
   users_url
 end

 helper.textilize("Hello world!")
 helper.time_ago_in_words(2.days.ago)
 helper.users_url

You don't have to include the module:

 HelpersAnywhere.helper.time_ago_in_words(10.minutes_ago) # => 10 minutes

 HelpersAnywhere.with_helper do
   users_url 
 end
